```
This project aims to be a modified version of the 1.5.42 version of the
Sliver command and control framework. This repository will contain
some modifications aimed at breaking common detections.
This will not be a fully AV/EDR bypass project. You will still need to
develop your own loader/dropper.

Installation:
- Requires golang version 1.20.7.
- After cloning the repo, delete the ".git" directory. I did not fix the issues related to this yet.
- Then simply run "make".
